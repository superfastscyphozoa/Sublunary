FrozenBlock - Wilder Wild - https://github.com/FrozenBlock/WilderWild

I used the Wilder Wild source code to learn how to do a number of things:

Use ColorProviderRegistry to colour certain blocks as the biome colour (If I recall correctly? I'm actually not 100% sure but I'm including it anyway)

Use datapools to provide multiple blockstates for WeightedBlockStateProvider

Use BiomeModifications.create to remove certain vanilla placed features from generating in biomes
